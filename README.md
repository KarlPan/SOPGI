# SOPGI
A SideFX Houdini VEX raytracer with photon mapping global illumination and full recursive reflections and refractions.

Tested on SideFX Houdini 16.x.x

 DISCLAIMER
______________________________________________________
 SOPGI is a personal side project to teach me
 how to do mostly global illumination with photons
 and many other things I learned on the way.
 It try to be correct enough to make things look good.

 It also doesn't want to be a renderer.
 It is mainly a solution to store lighting, shading and GI
 data into the geometry to use later for things
 like any other attribute.
