# SOPGI VEX Snippets
These include files contain VEX Functions and Code blocks from SOPGI itself.

They have been categorized and splitted into different files for your convenience.
You can just copy paste into your Houdini Wrangles the part of the code you need
like for example just one Shading Model function, etc. etc.

Remember to modify those as you need,
for example remapping channels and attributes to your very own.
